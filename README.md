# <strong>PROJECT LIST:</strong>

<strong>css-alphabetizer:</strong>
* Language: Bash
* Use: Takes in a block of CSS property list, alphabetize it, output it in 4-space tab format.
* Reason: Since I was reading about how alphabetizing the css code properties makes it easier to work in groups, I decided to apply it to one of my school project that I am fixing up during winter break. Then, I realize that is a LOT of copy and paster. Why not I just code a shortcut? And since I haven't done Bash for a while, and I am taking Linux Admin class soon, let's do it in bash! Thus begins the journey of bash review and hitting my head against the wall for messing up the sed codes,(all it takes one small space...), but that's a story for another time!
